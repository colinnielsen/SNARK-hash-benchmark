## ⏱ ZK-SNARK Hash Benchmarks 🏃🏽‍♂️
## Benchmarks of the Pedersen, Poseidon, MiMC, and SHA256 hash functions in Circom circuits
___
There are a few tradeoffs to keep in mind when hashing in ZK circuits. Below are a few benchmarks to help you choose a hash function for your circuit.

## Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/colinnielsen/SNARK-hash-benchmark.git --recursive

# build: NOTE - this will download the powers of tau trusted setup
bash ./compile.sh
```
